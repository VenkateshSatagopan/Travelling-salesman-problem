# Travelling-salesman-problem
Solving Travelling Salesman problem using simulated annealing

Run Main-Function.py to calculate fastest route cost using simulated annaeling between initially created four nodes

The function performs addition/deletion of nodes based on user-input

Graph_creation.py - Takes care of creation, addition, deletion of node

Fastest_route_calculation.py - Takes care of calculating the fastest route using simulated annaeling procedure
